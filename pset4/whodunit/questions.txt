1.  a library or header file that supports more type of number
2.  this means different types of data for different purpose u stands for 
3.  BYTE = 8-bit 
    DWORD = 32-bit
    LONG = 32-bit integer
    WORD = 16-bit
4.  BM (or 42 and 4d in hexidecimal)
5.  biSize is the size all of the file and bfSize is just the size of the picture
6.  the image is reversed
7.  biBitCount
8.  not have access to the file or computer memory is full
9.  because it capture the whole size of of a chunk of memory of BITMAPFILEHEADER,RGBTRIPLE, etc at the second agrument of the function.
10. 3 (#notetoself: the last % 4 of the equation is needed because in case width*sizeof(RGBTRIPPLE) % 4 = 0
11. it simply change the location for the pointer in the file
12. a variable for the fseek function at the current spot of the pointer
